Server Tick
===
This Minecraft mod makes the TPS graph in the F3 Debug screen work on servers in the same way as in singleplayer.
The mod must be installed both on the server and on the client. Currently, only players
that are `op` will see the graph. (This restriction is not in place on LAN games, everyone can see it there.)

Requires Fabric API.
